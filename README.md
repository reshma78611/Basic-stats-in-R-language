# Basic Statistics using R

## Basic Statistical operations such as :

## 1. Measures of central tendency : 

                        which tells about where centre of data is lying

        1. Mean:  
                Mean or average = (sum of elements/Total number of elements) 
        2. Median:
                 Median is the middle most value
        3. Mode:
                It is most Frequent Value

## 2. Measures of Dispersion: 

                        Dispersion from the mean

       1.Variance:
                The measure of variance from the mean
       2.Standard Deviation:
                Variance has sq units which is unacceptable practically so we go for standard deviation (sqrt(variance))
       3.Range:
                Range=Max-Min
                
## 3. Skewness:

       Measure of symmetry in distribution
       Skewness=0 or nearly 0 for normal distribution
       
## 4. Kurtosis:

       Measure of Peakness of Diastribution
       
## 5. Normal Distribution:

       Symmetrical arount mean.
       Area under curve is 100%
       Mean=0 and standard deviation=1 or constant
       
## 6. Z-score:

       To standardize the normal distribution we use this.
       Range is [-3,3]
        
## 7. T-score:

        To standardise the normal distribution when we dont have standard deviation
        
## 8 Visualizations:
        To understand data, we use visualizations
## 9 Confidence Interval:
        The interval in which we have confidence that our value is present

## Data used:

        Q7,Q9_a,Cars
        
## Programming :

        R - Language
